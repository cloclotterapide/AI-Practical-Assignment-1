#Additional software requirements
#At the beginning of the game, the game software randomly generates 5 numbers in the range of
20000 to 30000, but those that are initially divisible by 3, 2 and 4. The human-player chooses which
of the generated numbers he wants to start the game with.

#Game description
#At the beginning of the game, the number chosen by the human-player is given. Both players have 0
points. Players take turns, dividing the current number by 2, 3 or 4 in each turn. It is possible to
divide a number only if the result is a whole number. If the division results in an even number, then
1 point is deducted from the opponent's points, if it is an odd number, then the player's own points
are increased by 1 point. The game ends when a number less than or equal to 10 has just been
acquired. If the players have the same number of points, then the result is a draw. Otherwise, the
player with more points wins
